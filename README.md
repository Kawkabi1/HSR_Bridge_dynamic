## Dynamic Behaviour Study of High-Speed Railway Bridges  

This repository contains MATLAB algorithms and models to study the dynamic behaviour of high-speed railway bridges using three methods:  

1. **Finite Element Model**: Developed using MATLAB.  
2. **Theoretical Model**: Formulations and analyses based on theoretical principles.  
3. **Abaqus Model**: Integrating finite element analysis using Abaqus.

- MATLAB (version 2014a or higher)  

## Usage  

Instructions on how to use the scripts:  
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open the MATLAB scripts in MATLAB.  
3. Follow the examples provided in the code comments.
